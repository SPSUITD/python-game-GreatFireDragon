I called the game **FRUIT GRABBER**. In this game you have to catch fruits that fly aroung and bring them to the basket. But basket won't stay at one place. Also you're limited by timer. **Catch as many fruits as you can**, increasing the amount of points! **Catch power-ups**, they can make you **basket bigger**, fruits will give **x2** points or even **add up time** to your timer.

## How to install?

**You use windows** you don't have to know anything about programming
>	 1. Download `main.rar` file
>	 2. Extract it anywhere you want
>	 3. Execute `main.exe` file

**In case if you use other OS**, you must have at least basic knowledge of how to perform following↓ 
>	 1. You will have to manually install python (I recommend using `3.9-3.10` version). 
>	 2. Than in your code editor, install everything from `requirements.txt`. 
>	 3. Simply excecute `main.py` file with python.
